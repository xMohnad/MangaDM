# MangaDM - Manga Download Manager

**MangaDM** is a command-line tool and Python library for downloading manga chapters based on the metadata specified in a JSON file.

## Installation

To install the MangaDM, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can then use `pip` to install from the source code or from a distribution package.

### Install from Source

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/xMohnad/MangaDM.git
    cd MangaDM
    ```

2. Install the tool:
    ```sh
    pip install .
    ```

### Install from Distribution Package

If you have a `.tar.gz` file, you can install it using `pip`:

```sh
pip install dist/MangaDM*.tar.gz
```

-   or `.whl`

```sh
pip install dist/MangaDM*py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the `mangadm` command to download manga chapters. Here are the available options

### Example Commands

```sh
mangadm [OPTIONS] [JSON_FILE]
```

#### Basic Usage

```sh
mangadm /path/to/manga.json
```

This command will download all chapters specified in the `manga.json` file to the current directory.

#### Specify Destination Path

```sh
mangadm /path/to/manga.json --dest /path/to/save
```

This command will download all chapters to the specified destination path.

#### Limit Number of Chapters

```sh
mangadm /path/to/manga.json --limit 10
```

This command will download only the first 10 chapters.

#### Force Re-download of Existing Files

```sh
mangadm /path/to/manga.json --force
```

This command will re-download files even if they already exist.

#### Delete Data After Successful Download

```sh
mangadm /path/to/manga.json --delete
```

This command will delete the chapter data from the JSON file after a successful download.


#### Enable Transient Mode

```sh
mangadm /path/to/manga.json --transient
```

This command will enable transient mode, where progress indicators are not persisted after the download process completes.

#### Set and Save Default Settings

To set and save your current settings as the default, use the `--set-settings` option:

```sh
mangadm /path/to/manga.json --dest /path/to/save --limit 10 --force --delete --set-settings
```

-   or

```sh
mangadm /path/to/manga.json --dest /path/to/save --limit 10 --no-force --no-delete --set-settings
```

This command will save the current settings (destination path, chapter limit, force re-download, delete on success) as the default for future downloads.


### Example JSON Structure

If you want to see an example of the expected JSON structure for the input file, you can use the `--example` option:

```sh
mangadm --example
``` 

### Options

-   `--delete/--no-delete` or `-d`: Delete chapter data from JSON after successful download.
-   `format` or `-m` [cbz|epub]: The format in which to save the downloaded manga. Can be either `"cbz"` for a comic book archive or `"epub"` for an e-book file. Defaults to `"cbz"`.
-   `--transient/--no-transient` or `-t`: Activate transient mode (progress bar will disappear after completion).
-   `--example` or `-e`: Display an example JSON structure for the input file.
-   `--configure` or `-c`: when enabled, opens a text-based user interface to configure or change settings.

## Using MangaDM as a Library

You can also use MangaDM as a Python library. Hereâ€™s how you can use it programmatically:

### Example Usage

# Create an instance of MangaDM with desired parameters
mangadm = MangaDM(
    json_file="path/to/yourfile.json",
    dest_path="path/to/chapter",
    limit=1,
    delete_on_success=False,
    force_download=False,
    format="cbz", # ["cbz", "epub"]
    transient=True
)

# Start the downloading process
mangadm.start()
```

### Parameters
